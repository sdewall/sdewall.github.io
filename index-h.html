          To many, a hamburger is merely a kit of parts. As an assemblage consisting of mutilated animal carcass, grain,
          and sometimes sliced post mortem photosynthesized organisms, it is a relatively barbaric dish. As society has
          advanced, so has the hamburger - and not merely by the advent of applying the extracted dairy product of the
          same animal to the top of its flesh, aka the “Cheeseburger”.
        <br/>

          What makes a burger today is the experience of chowing down on this delicious conglomerate of raw food materials into
          a meal of yummy proportions. The experience is more than the burger itself, as it should be. The burger is merely the
          destination. The anticipation, arrival, aesthetic atmosphere, the architectural craft (or lack thereof) of both the
          environment and the burger itself combined are the journey. If one seen Lord of the Rings, they will soon realize
          that the experience is held within the journey.

          “With great power comes great responsibility.” This applies to user burger experience interface architecture, and
          unfortunately, too many so called “chefs” are not up to the task. “Half-ass” burgers are one of the greatest tragedies
          in the world in our humble opinion. This manifesto is designed as an inspirational source of information for one to guard
          themselves from a lackluster burger-eating experience. We believe that through a comprehensive rating and education system,
          this website will foster a community of accountability and the creation of more “whole-ass” burger-consumption experiences.
